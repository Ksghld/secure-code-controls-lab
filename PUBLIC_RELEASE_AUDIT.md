# Public Release Audit

Date: 2026-11-03. Content review: PASS for the audited local release set.
Publication: BLOCKED pending administrator onboarding and reviewed public identity binding.
A content PASS is not authentication, publication authorization, or remote enforcement.

## Scope and performed checks
- Source, tests, fixture data, filenames, workflow metadata, documentation and reachable
  clean local Git history reviewed. Original source directory/history was not imported.
- Read-only heuristic scanner run against nonignored worktree files and committed history.
  It checks private keys, common token forms, credential assignments, private IPv4,
  emails, URLs, nonregular/binary entries and sensitive filenames. No secret candidates found.
- Identifying-context search found no personal names, original project context, internal
  hosts, private infrastructure identifiers or private repository inventory.
- Public documentation is referenced by name without embedding an external endpoint.
- Commit authors/committers/messages reviewed: generic lab attribution and a GitHub
  noreply bot identity in earlier central commits; no personal authorship details.
  Those earlier bot-attributed commits were created locally, not by hosted Actions,
  and do not prove GitHub execution. New commits use generic non-deliverable lab attribution.
- No remotes configured. No original source history is reachable in either repository.
  Virtual environments, caches and generated reports are ignored and excluded.
- Public repository names and the application registry's GitHub repository ID are
  authorized lab identifiers. Resource account 000000000000, hashes, owners and
  deployment records remain synthetic.
- Private administrator request and execution-context findings remain outside both repositories.
- No new credentials, hosted secrets, self-hosted runners, or authorization changes.

## Immutable dependency review
Caller workflow revision: cd778ccf709701f9682c76cedbdd9ab096a0203c.
Central scanner/policy revision: 76ce1e187c6e01e4cc30eaad75f26fd25f4dc774.
Local tests compare these pinned files with the tested source, rather than only
checking that strings look like SHAs. Human approval of revisions remains required.
Official upstream release pages matched checkout v4.2.2 and upload-artifact v4.6.2
to the immutable SHAs used in the workflow. This is provenance identification,
not a full security audit of bundled third-party Action code.

## Limits and release procedure
Heuristic scanning plus manual review cannot prove the absence of every secret format.
Only the audited clean Git source is eligible for transfer; never copy entire local
directories, ignored files, Git configuration, or unrelated workspace metadata.
Any later identity binding, source or attribution change requires another audit.
Publish the required central revisions before application callers, through approved
feature branches and human-reviewed PRs. Do not rewrite pinned commit SHAs during transfer.
No repository creation, App-scope update, remote publication or enforcement was performed.
